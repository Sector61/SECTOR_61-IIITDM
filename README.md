<h3>Insulator Defect Detection System for Power Transmission Lines<h3>

This project introduces an innovative approach for detecting insulator defects on power transmission lines using advanced AI technology.

<h3>Overview<h3>

The system utilizes the Jetson Nano platform mounted onto a drone for efficient aerial inspection of transmission lines. This setup enables high-resolution imaging and real-time defect identification.

<h3>Features<h3>

  1.Drone-based Inspection: Drones equipped with Jetson Nano conduct aerial inspections of transmission lines.
  
  2.AI-powered Defect Detection: Sophisticated algorithms accurately identify and classify insulator defects.
  
  3.Geofencing Technology: Precisely delineates inspection areas for comprehensive coverage.
  
  4.Web Portal Integration: Detected defects are automatically pinpointed and transmitted to a web portal for analysis.
  
  5.Efficiency and Risk Mitigation: Enhances inspection efficiency and ensures the integrity of power transmission lines by promptly detecting defects.

<h3>Implementation<h3>

The system combines AI technology, edge computing, drone-based inspection, and geofencing to facilitate proactive maintenance of power infrastructure.
